CareBridge is a lightweight hyperlocal platform that connects neighbors and volunteers for real, immediate help — built for safe, practical action. Its sustainable model mixes low-cost supporter subscriptions and micro-donations (web checkout) managed through RevenueCat so the team can focus on growth and impact rather than billing plumbing. Ship in the Shipaton window, and you’ll satisfy the platform rules while delivering measurable, fundable social value.

Why this app, now? Post-COVID the world still faces local social fractures: loneliness, fragile community support, and distributed resource gaps. Hyperlocal, trust-centric social apps and mental-health focused solutions have traction in 2024–2025 — and monetization via subscriptions + web donations is now flexible thanks to modern platforms like RevenueCat and partners (so you can both serve a social cause and sustain the app).

Why CareBridge fits Shipaton + RevenueCat
Shipaton requirement: Ship a new app to iOS between the Shipaton window and integrate RevenueCat SDK for at least one purchase. (You’ll qualify by shipping CareBridge and wiring RevenueCat.) 

Revenue model that aligns with social good: monthly supporter subscriptions, organizer subscriptions (for NGOs / organizers), and one-time micro-donations (web checkout) — RevenueCat supports both native subscriptions and web one-time purchases via Stripe/Checkout integration. 

New payments landscape: Recent integrations (Paddle ↔ RevenueCat) and regulatory changes make linking web billing / external payments more practical for cross-platform monetization; this helps fund social features while respecting platform rules.

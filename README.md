Why this app, now? Post-COVID the world still faces local social fractures: loneliness, fragile community support, and distributed resource gaps. Hyperlocal, trust-centric social apps and mental-health focused solutions have traction in 2024–2025 — and monetization via subscriptions + web donations is now flexible thanks to modern platforms like RevenueCat and partners (so you can both serve a social cause and sustain the app).
